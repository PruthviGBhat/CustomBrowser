# Custom Browser Project

This project is a custom browser built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the functionality of the Chrome browser with a unique design. The browser displays the current time, a Google search bar, and a list of frequently used websites.

## Usage

To use this custom browser, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Adding Custom Browser to Chrome

To set this custom browser as your startup page in Chrome, follow these steps:

1. Open Chrome and go to **Settings**.

2. In the left-hand menu, click on **On startup**.

3. Check the radio button that says **Open a specific page or set of pages**.

4. Click on **Add a new page**.

5. Enter the URL where you have hosted the custom browser (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

6. Click **Add**.

Now, whenever you start Chrome, it will open with the custom browser page.

## Features
